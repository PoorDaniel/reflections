How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

  
It just showed me the differences->faster

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more 
efficient programmer in the long term?

   
 learn from past mistakes, see progress, see what others have done,..

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a 
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?


 pros: übersichtlich, only logical coherent changes
cons:no omissions, no effort, maybe too many versions

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple 
files in one commit, while others,
 like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

   because some of those files interact with eachother?


How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
git log ...shows the last commits
git diff ....followed by two git ids....compares them



How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?
   
i can always go back to the old commit that worked, 

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    
i'd like to try to have different versions of code and probably share with others on github afterwards, and practice general programming skills :)
